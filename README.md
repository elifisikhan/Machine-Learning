Terms to know before starting...

### **Pandas**

Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. 

Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.



### Matplotlib

Pyplot is a Matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface. Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python, and the advantage of being free and open-source.

<u>Examples</u>

### The Iris DataSet

This is the "Iris" dataset.  Iris Data Set is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations . Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.



### Seaborn

**Seaborn** is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.  Several built-in themes for matplotlib graphic style
Color palettes selection tools to create beautiful drawings that show the patterns in your data.



### Scikit-Learn

 It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

Scikit-learn Features:

data processing,
Dimensional shrinkage,
model selection,
regression,
classification,
cluster analysis.

### Numpy

**NumPy** is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. 

Why Use NumPy?

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
